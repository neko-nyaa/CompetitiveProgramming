# CompetitiveProgramming

This was originally a repository for the [Online Free Problem-Solving Coaching](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/59131) by Mr.Mostafa Saad. I am currently inactive on his Supervision, but this repository is still updated from time to time.

In here are some problems that I find interesting, or just some problems I've solved on a random contest, or just solving for fun. Each (maybe not all) of the solutions here contain a header containing a short (or not-so-short) explanation on how to solve them. It's kind of a mini-editorial. All of these codes have gotten an "Accepted" verdict at some time.

If you have any questions or doubts regarding my solutions/explanations, or if you just want to talk :), feel free to contact me on [my Codeforces account](https://codeforces.com/profile/neko_nyaa).
